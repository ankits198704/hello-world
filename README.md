# hello-world

Hello Everyone,

My name is Ankit Sharma. This is my first repository on github.
I'm creating this repository to learn the concept of this amazing version control system called Github. 
I'm really fascinated by the fact that github promotes collaboration and helps breaking the silos and let all 
the developers work collaborately, achieving the goals of the project and creating the best product avoiding 
all the conflicts that used to occur in traditional software development life cycle. This is just the beginning 
and I look forward to contribute more to the open source community. 

Thanks and Regards,
Ankit
